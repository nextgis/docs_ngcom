How to publish data using standard protocols
=========================================================

:ref:`Web GIS <ngcom_description>` allows to publish uploaded and connected geodata using standard :term:`WFS` Ð¸ :term:`WMS` protocols. In this case Web GIS acts like WFS(WFS-T)/WMS server.

WMS service
-----------

#. Open :ref:`Resource group <ngcom_resources_group>` where you want to create a service (by default from the main page of Web GIS you can access Main resource group);
#. Press **Create resource** and select **WMS service**;
#. In the opened dialog fill in the field :guilabel:`Display name` in :guilabel:`Resource` tab;
#. Go to :guilabel:`WMS service` tab and select those resources (:ref:`Styles <ngcom_styles>` or :ref:`WMS layers <ngcom_wms_layer>`) which you want to publish using WMS protocol. **You need to specify a keyname for each resource**;
#. Press **Create** button. If WMS service is created successfully you'll see its name in :guilabel:`Child resources` pane of the relevant Resource group.

.. _ngcom_wfs_service:

WFS service
-----------

WFS services are used to serve and edit vector layers hosted in Web. You can edit vector geodata using various :ref:`desktop <ngcom_ngqgis_connect_data_edit>` applications.

#. Open :ref:`Resource group <ngcom_resources_group>` where you want to create a service (by default from the main page of Web GIS you can access Main resource group);
#. Press **Create resource** and select **WFS service**;
#. In the opened dialog fill in the field :guilabel:`Display name` in :guilabel:`Resource` tab;
#. Go to :guilabel:`WFS service` tab and select those resources (:ref:`Vector layers <ngcom_vector_layer>` or :ref:`PostGIS layers <ngcom_postgis_layer>`) which you want to publish using WFS protocol. **You need to specify a keyname for each layer**;
#. Press **Create** button. If WFS service is created successfully you'll see its name in :guilabel:`Child resources` pane of the relevant Resource group.

WFS service link is not meant to be opened with a web browser. You need to copy and paste it in the WFS-capable client, such as for example `NextGIS QGIS <http://nextgis.com/nextgis-qgis/>`_.

By default WFS service provides 1000 features. To increase this number change :guilabel:`Default count of returned features` value in :guilabel:`WFS service` tab.

You can also quickly create a WFS service with :ref:`NextGIS Connect <ngcom_ngqgis_connect_wfs_service>`.
