.. _ngcom_embed_webmap_settings:

Embeded map settings
------------------------

**Map size** - width and height in pixels.

**Link to the main map** - to go from the site to the map page in the Web GIS.

**Generate events** - for integration and programmatic interaction with the iframe.

You can also embed a Web Map with additional tools and panels. This will allow users, for instance, to enable and disable particular layers. 

**Tools** available for embeded map:

- feature identification;
- measuring area and distance;
- cursor location and extent coordinates;
- scale line;
- initial extent;
- marking user location;
- zoom;
- scale info.

You can also choose which **panels** will be available on the map:

- description;
- layers;
- search.

If several panels are added, you can use the **Active panel** menu to select one of them to be displayed by default or have the map open with the panels minimized.

All settings are included in the code.

and the `NGW API <https://docs.nextgis.com/docs_ngweb_dev/doc/toc.html>`_.

How to share a link to a particular Web Map feature
---------------------------------------------------------

Using specially generated GET queries you can share a link to a particular feature of a layer. The link will open with the geographical context that you can select in the Web Map settings.

All you need to do is create links in the information systems. By clicking on them users will be directed to the map with the selected feature and context.

Such links can be automatically generated by your system integrated with NextGIS Web.

Here's an example:

https://demo.nextgis.com/resource/7023/display?panel=layers&hl_lid=7021&hl_attr=OSM_ID&hl_val=135456188&zoom=18

* https://demo.nextgis.com/resource/7023/display?panel=layers - the "pure" Web Map link;
* hl_lid – layer ID;
* hl_attr – attribute (name of attribute field of feature ID);
* hl_val – value of feature ID;
* zoom - value in numbers with 1 as a minimum.

You can make the link manually (`more on how to do it <https://docs.nextgis.com/docs_ngweb/source/webmaps_client.html#ngw-webmaps-client-feature-link>`_).
