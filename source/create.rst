.. _ngcom_auth_id_webgis:

Allow team members to access Web GIS using NextGIS ID
-----------------------------------------------

Users added to the `team <https://docs.nextgis.com/docs_ngcom/source/create.html#ngcom-team-management>` do not automatically become users of the Web GIS. To get access to the Web GIS, the user must log in to it.
By default a new Web GIS user has no permissions. Set up permissions for your team before their first login.
It can be done in one of two ways:

* The best way is to set up permissions for a `user group <https://docs.nextgis.com/docs_ngweb/source/admin_tasks.html#ngw-create-group>`_ with the option "New users" enabled. Users will be included in this group upon their first login to the Web GIS.
* An alternative way is to set up permissions for the principal "Authenticated".
