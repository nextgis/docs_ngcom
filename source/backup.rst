Backup policy
============

Data backups are performed for every Web GIS (any plan). The frequency depends on total data volume and Web GIS use activity (once or several times per month).

Restoring data from backups is available for `Premium <https://nextgis.com/pricing-base/>`_ users only. Other plans Web GIS are backup-ed to mitigate possible infrastructure risks not related to user actions.

If you are on Premium and need a restore - send us a request to support@nextgis.com. We'll let you know which dates are available. Additionally, you can see the last backup date 
under System information section of your Web GIS' Control panel (subsection Platform - Last backup).
