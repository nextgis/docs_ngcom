How to manage data storage
==========================================

:ref:`Web GIS <ngcom_description>` allows you to create Resource groups to arrange storage of geodata. For example, you can create separate Resource groups to store data related to different projects or to combine data layers of the same type. To create a new Resource group:

#. Open Web GIS main page (by default you can access Main resource group from it);
#. Select :menuselection:`Create resource --> Resource group` on the right side of Web GIS :ref:`admin console <ngw_admin_interface>`;
#. In the opened dialog fill in the field :guilabel:`Display name` in :guilabel:`Resource` tab;
#. Press :guilabel:`Create` button. If Resource group is created successfully you'll see its name in Main resource group on Web GIS main page.

Now you can access newly created Resource group and create new resources in it.

.. note:: 
	You can also create new Resource groups in Web GIS :ref:`with desktop app NextGIS QGIS <ngcom_ngqgis_connect_resource_group>`.
