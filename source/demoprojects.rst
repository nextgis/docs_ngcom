Demo projects
===============

These projects showcase the capabilities of NextGIS Web, allowing you to get acquainted with its features. If you've set up a Web GIS and wish to test the platform but don't know where to begin, try out the demo projects.

To access demo projects go to the main page of **your Web GIS** and log in as the **administrator**. You can open the demo projects page in one of two ways:

* From the actions pane on the right
* Using the button below the list of Web GIS resources

When you clone a demo project, it is yours to edit, reset or delete (see :numref:`demo_project_cloned_pic`). 

In the list of your Web GIS resources the folder of the cloned demo project is marked with a lab flask icon.
